Analog Devices, Inc. CrossCore(R) Embedded Studio Application Example


Project Name: 	Multi_Channel_Filter_Auto_Iterate

Description :	This project performs multichannel FIR. FIR is performed on two channels.
		The input to the two channels is given from indata256.dat and indata1024.dat. 
		The output on both the channels can be compared with the Matlab generated output 
		files expectedoutput256.dat and expectedoutput1024.dat. They compare 
		upto few decimal points.

Processor: 	ADSP-21479

Tested with:

		ADSP-21479 EZ-BOARD 
 		Analog Devices CrossCore Embedded Studio
    		ADZS-HPUSB-ICE

Instructions:	- Open and build the project.
		- Load project into a debug configuration.
		- Run the program.

		NOTE: steps to below ONLY work for the example when built for debug build configuration.

		- Select Memory from the Window, Show View. 
		- Add memory to monitor by clicking on the "+" icon in the Memory tab.
		- Enter Out_Buf2 as the address or expression to monitor and set the memory type to Data(DM) Memory.
		- Click OK.
		- Right click in Data Memory pane to set the format to set the number of columns to 2.
		- Click on the New Renderings tab to set the rendering to Floating point 32 bit.
		- Click on the Add Rendering(s) button.
.  
		You can compare the two outputs generated by the code Out_Buf1 with the Matlab file
		expectedoutput256.dat and Out_Buf2 with the Matlab generated file expectedoutput1024.dat.

Hardware Setup:	No hardware configuration required
